#DtdAnalyzer

DtdAnalyzer provides a set of tools:

* **dtdanalyzer** - creates an XML representation (using elements and attributes)
  of an XML DTD
* **dtddocumentor** - generates pretty HTML documentation, including annotations (if
  present) from specially-formatted comments of the DTD
* **dtdflatten** - flattens a multi-file DTD into one big file. See also the Perl script
  script/dtdflatten.pl.
* **dtdcompare** - compares two DTDs and generate a report of differences
* **dtd2xml2json** - generates XSLT to convert instance documents into JSON format.
* **dtdschematron** - generates a schematron file from the DTD, including extra
  schematron rules (if present) from specially-formatted comments of the DTD
* **scaffold.xsl** - generates XSLT scaffolding that can be used as a starting point
  for writing a transform from one schema to another

## Home page and documentation

The home page for this project is at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/ncbi/dtdanalyzer.

Detailed documentation is available on the [GitHub
wiki](https://github.com/NCBITools/DtdAnalyzer/wiki).

##Quick start

* Download the latest release, either as a zip file:
  [DtdAnalyzer-0.5.zip](http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/ncbi/dtdanalyzer/downloads/DtdAnalyzer-0.5.zip);
  or as a gzipped tar:
  [DtdAnalyzer-0.5.tar.gz](http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/ncbi/dtdanalyzer/downloads/DtdAnalyzer-0.5.tar.gz).

  _**Note:**  Do not use the "Zip" download button on the main GitHub page!
  That button downloads the *source files*, not the pre-built packages.
  They are different!_

* Unzip that file on your machine.

* Open up a Windows command or a bash shell window.  Add the path to the package root
  to your PATH environment variable.

  On Windows:

  ```
  set PATH=%PATH%;-path-to-dtdanalyzer-package-
  ```

  On Mac OS X or Unix:

  ```
  export PATH=$PATH:-path-to-dtdanalyzer-package-
  ```

* ***Note for Mac OS X:*** This software depends on a utility called `greadlink`, which
  might not be installed on your system. To see whether or not it is, enter
  `which greadlink` at a terminal prompt.  If it is not installed, then the easiest way
  to get it is with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/). Install Homebrew, if necessary, and
  then enter `brew install coreutils`.

* Try the following command (which analyzes the
  [Journal Archiving and Interchange](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/1.0/dtd.html)
  flavor of the [NLM/NISO Journal Article Tag Suite](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/), and
  writes the output to a file):

  ```
  dtdanalyzer http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/1.0/JATS-archivearticle1.dtd out.daz.xml
  ```

* Check that you have sensible results in the output file, `out.daz.xml`.

* As another example, the next command produces HTML documentation for that DTD.  It should
  run for a little while and then announce that it's done, and that the documentation is in
  the `doc` subdirectory. (Enter all on one line).

  ```
  dtddocumentor http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/1.0/JATS-archivearticle1.dtd
    --exclude mml: --exclude-except mml:math
  ```

* Open the `doc/index.html` file in a browser, and check that it looks good.

* Run `--help` with any of the tools for more complete usage information,
  or continue by visiting the documentation pages on the [GitHub
  wiki](https://github.com/NCBITools/DtdAnalyzer/wiki).
